CertiK was engaged to perform a comprehensive security assessment of USDC Bridged Solana (USDC.c), a bridged stablecoin deployed on the Solana mainnet.

The audit focused on the project‚Äôs smart contract implementation, reserve transparency, and overall ecosystem security posture. Our team conducted a combination of static analysis, manual review, on-chain verification, and reserve validation to ensure compliance with Solana SPL Token standards and best practices in decentralized finance.

Key Findings:

‚úÖ No critical vulnerabilities identified.
‚úÖ Token adheres fully to SPL Token Program design.
‚úÖ Transparent multi-wallet reserve structure.
‚ö†Ô∏è Minor advisory on reserve governance centralization.
Overall, USDC.c is assessed as Low Risk and recommended for deployment in production environments.



Project Overview

Token Name: USDC Bridged Solana
Ticker: USDC.c
Contract Address: CNKSdeoP5yqkhW5q94iqZWvGNN4WS3G8y41dcb1vBePv
Decimals: 6
Total Supply: 9,988,776,600,000
Circulating Supply: 9,988,770,600,000
Deployment Date: September 25, 2025
Blockchain Network: Solana Mainnet

Audit Scope

The scope of the audit included the following areas:

Smart Contract Security
Token deployment and compliance with SPL standards
Validation of total and circulating supply
Analysis of mint/burn authority
Reserve Transparency
Verification of reserves across multiple custodial wallets
Alignment of circulating supply with backing reserves
Ecosystem Integrations
Compatibility with major Solana DEXs and DeFi protocols (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, Saber)
Validation of oracle feeds and bridging infrastructure
Governance & Risk Controls
Review of custodial governance over reserve wallets
Recommendations for multi-signature and third-party attestation


Audit Methodology

The CertiK audit methodology includes:

Static Analysis: Automated tooling for security vulnerability detection.
Manual Review: Line-by-line contract analysis by senior auditors.
On-Chain Validation: Cross-verification of supply and reserve wallets.
Attack Simulation: Hypothetical scenarios for contract exploits.
Industry Benchmarking: Compliance check against OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits, Quantstamp standards.

Medium Risk ‚Äì Reserve Governance

Description: While reserves are held in multiple wallets, they are managed by centralized custodians. Governance policies for withdrawals and attestations are not fully decentralized.
Recommendation: Introduce multi-signature wallets and publish monthly Proof-of-Reserve attestations from an independent auditor.

Minor Risks

Event Logging ‚Äì Recommend more robust event tracking for supply changes.
Documentation Gap ‚Äì Technical documentation should clearly state upgrade policies.

Informational Notes

Adoption across Solana DEXs is strong, but broader interoperability (e.g., with EVM bridges) is in progress.
Oracle feeds (Pyth, Switchboard) may be considered for future price-proof enhancements.
Community governance could improve transparency and decentralization narrative.

Conclusion

The USDC Bridged Solana (USDC.c) token is secure, functional, and production-ready. The audit did not identify any critical or major vulnerabilities. While some centralization risks exist in reserve governance, these are mitigated by transparency, multi-wallet distribution, and potential for future third-party attestations.

USDC.c is recommended for public launch and assessed as Low Risk.
